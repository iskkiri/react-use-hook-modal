Try different use cases directly in your browser.

## Installation

Install the package with your package manager of choice:

npm

```shell
npm install react-use-hook-modal
```

yarn

```shell
yarn add react-use-hook-modal
```

pnpm

```shell
pnpm add react-use-hook-modal
```

## Getting set up

To start using react-use-hook-modal, wrap your application with the ModalProvider.

```tsx
import { ModalProvider } from 'react-use-hook-modal';

export default App = ({ children }) {
  return (
    <ModalProvider>
      {children}
    </ModalProvider>
  );
}
```

## Basic Usage

To open a modal, you can use the `useModal` hook as shown below.

```tsx
import { useModal } from 'react-use-hook-modal';
import MyModalComponent from './MyModalComponent';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { open, close } = useModal(MyModalComponent);

  const onOpenModal = useCallback(() => {
    open({
      onClose: close,
      onConfirm: () => {
        console.log('Confirmed');
        close();
      },
    });
  }, []);

  return <button onClick={onOpenModal}>Open Modal</button>;
};
```

You can integrate `react-use-hook-modal` with libraries like `react-transition-group` to add animations to your modals:

```tsx
import { ModalProvider } from 'react-use-hook-modal';
import { TransitionGroup } from 'react-transition-group';

const App = ({ children }) => {
  return <ModalProvider container={TransitionGroup}>{children}</ModalProvider>;
};
```

## API Reference

### ModalProvider

| Prop           | Type                          | Default            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `children`     | `React.ReactNode`             | **Required**       | The child elements rendered inside the `ModalProvider`. Typically, this is your application that interacts with the modals.                                                                                          |
| `container`    | `React.ComponentType`         | `React.Fragment`   | Optional custom container component for rendering modals. Use this to define a custom container, allowing you to integrate modal animations with libraries like React Transition Group.                              |
| `clearTime`    | `number`                      | `3000` (3 seconds) | The time in milliseconds before a modal is fully removed from the internal state (`modals`) after closing. This ensures that any exit animations are fully displayed before the modal is removed from the state.     |
| `onAfterOpen`  | `(modal: ModalState) => void` | `undefined`        | A callback function triggered immediately after any modal is opened. It provides the state of the modal that was just opened. This can be useful for setting focus or starting animations based on the opened modal. |
| `onAfterClose` | `(modal: ModalState) => void` | `undefined`        | A callback function triggered immediately after any modal is closed. It provides the state of the modal that was just closed, allowing for cleanup tasks or triggering actions based on the closed modal's state.    |

### useModal

`useModal` is a custom hook designed to manage the opening and closing of modals in a React application. It takes a modal component as input and returns two functions: `open` and `close`, which can be used to control the modal's visibility.

| Parameter   | Type                          | Description                                                                                                   |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Component` | `React.ComponentType<TProps>` | The modal component to be rendered. This component should have an `isOpen` prop that controls its visibility. |

#### Returns:

The `useModal` hook returns the following functions:

| Return Value | Type                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `open`       | `(props: Omit<TProps, 'isOpen'>, options?: OpenModalOptions) => void` (if required props exist) <br> `(props?: Omit<TProps, 'isOpen'>, options?: OpenModalOptions) => void` (if all props are optional) | Opens the modal. If the modal component has required props, those props must be provided. If all props are optional, `open` can be called without any props. Additionally, you can pass options such as `key` and `portalTarget`.                                                                                                                      |
| `close`      | `(key?: string \| number) => void`                                                                                                                                                                      | Closes the modal. Optionally, a modal key can be passed to close a specific modal instance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `key`        | `string \| number`                                                                                                                                                                                      | A unique identifier for the modal. It is rarely needed, as most interactions rely on `open` and `close`. However, it can be useful in specific cases where you need to track or manage a particular modal's state manually. <br> **Note**: If you provide a custom key when opening a modal, it will be different from the key returned by `useModal`. |

#### OpenModalOptions

The `OpenModalOptions` is an optional parameter for the `open` function returned by `useModal`. It allows users to customize the behavior of the modal when opening.

| Option         | Type               | Description                                                                                                                              |
| -------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `key`          | `string \| number` | (Optional) A unique key for identifying the modal instance. Useful when managing multiple modals simultaneously.                         |
| `portalTarget` | `HTMLElement`      | (Optional) The DOM element where the modal will be rendered. Useful when you want to render the modal in a specific container or portal. |

### useModalsState

`useModalsState` is a custom hook designed to access the current state of all modals in your application.

#### Returns:

The `useModalsState` hook returns the current state of modals.

| Return Value | Type                 | Description                                                                                                 |
| ------------ | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `modals`     | `Array<ModalObject>` | Each modal object contains information about the modal, such as the component, its props, and a unique key. |
